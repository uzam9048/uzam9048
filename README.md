<!-- SECTION: ABOUT -->
## ✦ About Me  
I’m an AI Engineer deeply invested in architecting **agentic and multi-agent systems**, designing **RAG pipelines**, and building **scalable LLM-powered applications**.  

My work revolves around creating systems that blend:  
- structured reasoning  
- automated decision flows  
- dynamic retrieval  
- efficient orchestration  
- resilient deployment  

Automation, intelligence, and clean engineering are my core principles.

<!-- SECTION: SPECIALTIES -->
## ✦ What I Specialize In  
### **1. Agentic & Multi-Agent Workflows**  
Designing agents that coordinate, route tasks, integrate tools, and maintain contextual state.

### **2. Retrieval-Augmented Systems (RAG)**  
Crafting high-fidelity retrieval stacks: parsing, embeddings, chunking, indexing, and caching.

### **3. LLM Engineering**  
Model adaptation, evaluation frameworks, fine-tuning, and scalable LLM/SLM deployment.

### **4. MLOps & Cloud-Native AI**  
Productionizing AI systems with CI/CD, containerization, orchestration, and microservice design.

### **5. Trading Automation (Side Focus)**  
Exploring algorithmic trading and backtesting using Python, PineScript, and MT5.
